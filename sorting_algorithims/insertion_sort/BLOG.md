# Blog Notes: Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a O(n) in place sorting algorithm that mimics sorting a hand of cards in hand.

By keeping all sorted items in a set apart, insertion sort minimizes resorting. Additionally, because it is based on a real world problem, it is easy to conceptualize when working with!
